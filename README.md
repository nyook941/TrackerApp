# Poop Tracker

## Purpose
Although the title of this project may seem silly, the aim of this app is to help people who struggle with bowel issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome, diharrea, constipation and so on. This is acheived by tracking the quantity and properties of your poops, so you can track improvements in your health, or see when you need improvement.

## Techincal info
Currently, this app is coded soley using Flutter. Eventually, I plan on adding in a global state management tool such as Redux or Cubit. Finally, I plan to add a on board database using SQLite.
